# Installation — Hostinger MCP Server

This skill targets the **official Hostinger MCP** — a local npm server (`hostinger-api-mcp`) that you run on your own machine and connect Claude to over stdio (or HTTP).

> **Source of truth:** [github.com/hostinger/api-mcp-server](https://github.com/hostinger/api-mcp-server). The package name, binaries, flags, and auth below are from that repo; if Hostinger changes them, the repo wins.

**Prerequisites**

- A Hostinger account with an **API token** generated in [hPanel](https://hpanel.hostinger.com).
- **Node.js v24+** (the server requires it).

---

## Step 1 — Install

**Preferred: do not install it globally at all.** The repo's committed `.mcp.json` launches the
server with `npx -y -p hostinger-api-mcp@1.8.2` — a pinned version, resolved per run, nothing
added to your PATH. If you use that route (Step 4), skip this step.

If you do want the category binaries on your PATH, **pin the version**:

```bash
npm install -g hostinger-api-mcp@1.8.2
# or
yarn global add hostinger-api-mcp@1.8.2
# or
pnpm add -g hostinger-api-mcp@1.8.2
```

> **Why pinned.** This process receives a token with **full authority over your Hostinger
> account** (Step 2). An unpinned install takes whatever the registry serves at that moment, on
> every install and every reinstall — so a hijacked or compromised release of the package, or of
> anything in its dependency tree, inherits that authority with no action on your part. Keep the
> pin equal to the one in `.mcp.json` and bump both together, after reading the upstream release
> notes at [github.com/hostinger/api-mcp-server](https://github.com/hostinger/api-mcp-server).

This installs the category binaries (see Step 3).

## Step 2 — Get the API token

1. Log in to [hPanel](https://hpanel.hostinger.com).
2. Open **API** and generate a token.
3. Copy the token.

The server sends it as a Bearer `Authorization` header. Set it in the `HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

> The token grants everything the account can do via the API. Treat it like a password — never commit it or print it in responses.

**OAuth alternative (stdio only).** Instead of a token you can authenticate interactively with OAuth 2.0 + PKCE:

```bash
hostinger-api-mcp --login    # opens a browser flow
hostinger-api-mcp --logout   # clears stored credentials
```

Credentials are stored at `~/.config/hostinger-mcp/credentials.json` as a **single central credential per machine**. Because OAuth can store only one credential, it **cannot separate accounts** — for multi-account use, prefer API tokens (see below).

### Handling the token safely

The token is equivalent to your hPanel password, and there is no per-tool permission at the MCP
layer — whoever holds it can call anything. Keep the value in **one** place, the environment
Claude Code itself starts with, and put a *placeholder* everywhere else.

**Never pass the token's value to `claude mcp add`.** Quote the placeholder so your shell does not
expand it:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio \
  -e 'HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN=${HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN:-}' \
  -s user \
  hostinger-vps hostinger-vps-mcp
```

The single quotes are the point. Written as `"$HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN"`, the shell expands it before
launching anything, so the live token is in that process's arguments — readable by any other user
on the machine through `ps` or `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` while the command runs — and `claude mcp add`
then stores the **resolved value** in `~/.claude.json` in plaintext, where it stays until you
remove the connection. Quoted as a placeholder, both the argument list and the stored config carry
only the literal `${HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN:-}`, and Claude Code expands it from its own environment
when it launches the server. Expansion applies to local- and user-scoped entries in
`~/.claude.json`, not only to a project `.mcp.json` — an unset reference there produces a
`Missing environment variables` warning in `claude mcp list`, which is the expansion pass running.
The `:-` default keeps the entry loading while the variable is unset (calls then fail auth, as with
the committed `.mcp.json`).

**Where the value itself lives.** It must be in the environment **Claude Code** starts with, so
that expansion has something to find:

```bash
printf 'Hostinger API token: '
read -rs HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN; echo
export HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN
```

`read -rs` does not echo the token and never writes it to `~/.zsh_history` / `~/.bash_history`, but
it only lasts for that shell — start Claude Code **from it**. For a persistent setup, put the
export in your shell profile and keep that file at mode 600, or better, have the profile read the
value from a keychain rather than storing it inline:

```bash
export HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN="$(security find-generic-password -s hostinger-api -w)"   # macOS
```

In claude.ai cloud sessions the equivalent is the environment's own environment variables — set
`HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN` there and the committed `.mcp.json` picks it up with no local setup at all.

**The OAuth credential file.** `~/.config/hostinger-mcp/credentials.json` holds a live credential
written by the upstream package. Check its mode (`ls -l`) and tighten it if needed (`chmod 600`),
and run `hostinger-api-mcp --logout` before leaving a shared or handed-over machine.

**If a token may have been exposed** — pasted into a chat, committed, left in a history file or an
old `~/.claude.json` entry — **revoke and regenerate it in hPanel**. There is no narrower recovery:
the token carries the whole account.

To check whether an old connection left a literal value behind, **parse** the file — and use a
test that reports presence without printing the value, which would put a possibly still-live
credential into your scrollback:

```bash
node -e '
const fs = require("fs"), p = require("os").homedir() + "/.claude.json";
let c; try { c = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(p, "utf8")); }
catch (e) { console.error("could not read " + p); process.exit(1); }
const all = [...Object.entries(c.mcpServers || {}),
             ...Object.values(c.projects || {}).flatMap(x => Object.entries(x.mcpServers || {}))];
// Literal material = everything outside ${...} placeholders, PLUS whatever
// sits in their ":-" defaults - a token hides just as well in
// ${HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN:-hst_live} as it does in a bare value.
const literal = v => { const re = /\$\{[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*(?::-([^}]*))?\}/g;
                       let n = v.replace(re, "").length;
                       for (const m of v.matchAll(re)) n += (m[1] || "").length;
                       return n; };
const hits = all.filter(([, s]) => { const v = (s.env || {}).HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN;
                                     return typeof v === "string" && literal(v) > 0; })
                .map(([n]) => n);
console.log(hits.length
  ? "Literal token stored in: " + hits.join(", ") + " — rotate it in hPanel, then re-add with the placeholder form."
  : "No literal token in ~/.claude.json.");
'
```

It prints connection **names**, never values. A line-based `grep` is not enough here: JSON may put
the value on the line after its key, which is valid and is a layout a pretty-printer can produce,
and `grep` matches one line at a time — so the check would report clean while the credential sits
in the file. (This repo's own CI no-leak guard carries a JSON-parsing pass for exactly that reason.)
It covers user-scope `mcpServers` and per-project entries alike, and treats a `${...}` placeholder
or an empty string as clean — but **not** a placeholder carrying a literal default. A token hides
just as well in `${HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN:-hst_live}`, which is still plaintext in the file and is
still what the server receives whenever the variable is unset, and it survives being split across
several defaults (`${A:-hst_}${B:-rest}`). The check sums the literal material inside and outside
the placeholders, which is the same rule this repo's CI no-leak guard applies to the tracked MCP
configs.

## Step 3 — Pick category binaries

The package ships seven binaries. Each exposes a subset of the 127 tools. Connect only the **smallest set** that covers your task — fewer tools keeps Claude's context lean and tool selection accurate.

| Binary | Tools | Use for |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `hostinger-vps-mcp` | 62 | VPS lifecycle, firewalls, snapshots, backups, public keys, post-install scripts |
| `hostinger-hosting-mcp` | 22 | shared hosting websites, subdomains, parked domains, databases, deployments |
| `hostinger-domains-mcp` | 18 | domain registration, forwarding, WHOIS profiles, locks, privacy, nameservers |
| `hostinger-reach-mcp` | 10 | Reach contacts, segments, groups, profiles |
| `hostinger-dns-mcp` | 8 | DNS records and snapshots |
| `hostinger-billing-mcp` | 7 | subscriptions, payment methods, catalog, auto-renewal |
| `hostinger-api-mcp` | all 127 | everything (only when you genuinely need broad coverage) |

---

## Step 4 — Connect Claude Code (stdio)

### Env var (zero-config — devices and cloud sessions)

The repo commits a `.mcp.json` that launches the server via `npx` (version-pinned) and reads
the `${HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN:-}` env placeholder — never a real token. Set that variable — in
your shell profile on a device, or in the claude.ai cloud environment's environment variables
for web/phone sessions — and the `hostinger` connection authenticates automatically. While
the variable is unset the config still parses (the `:-` default), but calls fail auth and the
connection shows as unavailable in `/mcp` — expected until you provide the token. By default
it loads the full `hostinger-api-mcp` (all 127 tools); set `HOSTINGER_MCP_BINARY` to a category
binary (e.g. `hostinger-vps-mcp`) to keep the tool surface lean. Never put a real token in
`.mcp.json` itself; it is tracked in git. Cloud environments with a restricted network policy
must allow the npm registry (for `npx`) and the Hostinger API.

### Per-category user-scope connections (for multi-category or multi-account work)

stdio is the default transport. Add one connection per binary you need. Example for the VPS binary,
with the token already in your environment (Step 2 — never type it into the command):

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio \
  -e 'HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN=${HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN:-}' \
  -s user \
  hostinger-vps hostinger-vps-mcp
```

> **Keep the single quotes.** They are what stops the shell from expanding the token into this
> command's arguments and into `~/.claude.json`; see "Handling the token safely" in Step 2. The
> variable itself must be set in the environment Claude Code starts with.

`-s user` stores it at the user level so it persists across projects. Repeat with a different name + binary for each category you need (e.g. `hostinger-dns hostinger-dns-mcp`).

> Verify the exact env-flag for `claude mcp add` in your Claude Code version with `claude mcp add --help` (it has varied across releases). The canonical config shape is in `.mcp.json.example` at the repo root.

After `claude mcp add`, **restart Claude Code** so the stdio server is launched and its tools load. Verify with `claude mcp list`; remove later with `claude mcp remove hostinger-vps`.

---

## Multi-account — multiple Hostinger accounts

Use **one connection per account**, each with its own `HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN`. Name them `hostinger-<account>` (or `hostinger-<account>-<category>` if you also split by binary) so the tool prefix tells you which account you're on:

Give each account its **own variable name**, and reference it as a placeholder — one token per
connection, none of them in a command line or in `~/.claude.json`:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio \
  -e 'HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN=${HOSTINGER_TOKEN_CLIENTA:-}' \
  -s user \
  hostinger-clienta-vps hostinger-vps-mcp

claude mcp add --transport stdio \
  -e 'HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN=${HOSTINGER_TOKEN_CLIENTB:-}' \
  -s user \
  hostinger-clientb-vps hostinger-vps-mcp
```

Export `HOSTINGER_TOKEN_CLIENTA` / `HOSTINGER_TOKEN_CLIENTB` in the environment Claude Code starts
with (Step 2). The variable the server receives is always `HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN` — only the source
differs per connection, which is what keeps the accounts separated.

> `claude mcp remove` a connection when an engagement ends, and unset its variable — a stale entry
> is a standing grant on someone else's account.

> **Use API tokens for multi-account.** OAuth stores ONE central credential per machine and cannot separate accounts — only env-scoped tokens can. See `.mcp.json.example` in the repo root for the JSON form across accounts.

---

## HTTP mode (optional)

To run over HTTP instead of stdio:

```bash
hostinger-api-mcp --http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8100
```

The API token (`HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN`) is **required** in HTTP mode. OAuth is **not supported** over HTTP — it works in stdio mode only.

---

## Verify the connection

In Claude, ask:

- **"List my Hostinger VPS"** → calls `VPS_getVirtualMachinesV1`, or
- **"List my domains"** → calls `domains_getDomainListV1`.

That round-trip confirms the install + token.

| Symptom | Meaning | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| No `mcp__hostinger*__*` tools | stdio server not loaded | restart Claude Code |
| `401 Unauthorized` | bad or missing token | re-check `HOSTINGER_API_TOKEN` against the token in hPanel |
| Node engine / version error | Node too old | install Node.js v24+ |

---

## Notes

- API reference: <https://developers.hostinger.com/>
- Tool names throughout this skill use the `Category_actionVn` convention and match `tools-catalog.md`. In Claude they appear as `mcp__<connection-name>__<tool>`. The **live** tools remain the source of truth if Hostinger adds or renames any.
